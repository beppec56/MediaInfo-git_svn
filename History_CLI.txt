+ #785338: Huge work on RealMedia parser (bitrate, channels, sampling rate, fps...)
x #1435086: Translation problems if the program is launched directly with a filename
x #1361647: Complete rewrite of MPEG-4 (newest Quicktime, 3GPP, iTunes...) parser to be more robust.
x Some minor (but crashing :( ) bug fixes
x AVI with DV was not well parsed

Version 0.7.1.0 2006-02-02

+ Support of Musepack files
+ Support of Flic (FLI/FLV) video files
+ Support of DTS-HD (DTS at 96 KHz / 24 bits)
+ Support of ID3 tags (v1 and v2) in .AAC files
+ Support of all Tags in AVI files
+ Detection of QuickTime image files and QuickTime compressed archives
+ Detection of AVC files (3GPP, 3GPP Mobile or JVT)
+ Detection of iTunes protected files

x #1420672 : No WMV bitrate
x Crash with some corrupted MPEG files
x Crash with some MP3 files with corrupted ID3v2 tags
x Crash with some Quicktime files with corrupted tags
x #1257550 (again :) ) : with AVI, rounding of FPS had an impact of FrameCount, based on FPS. Now based on AVI file (better ;-) )
x #1381652 : Reported some GIF files as Mpeg audio
x #1381619 : UPX compressor is no more used, to prevent Virus checker to use 100% CPU
x 2nd Video framerate forgotten
x Video languages were not parsed (example : "en" should be "English")
x FrameRate/String was forgeting measure (example : "at 25" should be "at 25 fps")
x Some case sensitive problems (example : "KBps" instead of "Kbps", 8 times more)
x DTS and AC3 channels position names were changed to be more human readable

Version 0.7.0.3 2005-11-14
---------------
NOTE : this version is released with urgency, because of Kaspersky anti-virus false-positive detection. It should be compatible with MediaInfo 0.6.1.1 (mainly for AutoGK compatibility), but I don't promise all works!
+ Uses MediaInfoLib 0.7.0.3
+ Text : URL for Text codecs
+ Support of ISO-639 language names (more than 200 language names can be translated)
+ Support of "multilanguage" language name (ISO-639 "mul")
x #1323208 : Video Bitrate for OGM files with VBR audio was incorrect
+ Better detection and handling of DivX container
+ #1327902 : More meta data properties for RIFF files
x #1327468 : RIFF (AVI) files with not-padded (INFO) sub chunks can't be parsed
+ More "generic" tags added
x Some other minor bugs
x #1257550 : rounding of FPS was 2 digit precise, not enougth, upgraded to 3 digits, and exact number is given (23.97 before, 23.970 or 23.976 now)
x Better false positive detection (mainly in MPEG1, MPEG2, MP3)
x some memory leaks if you use MediaInfo a long time
x MPEG Audio : VBR bitrate corrected for MPEG **1** streams
x MPEG Audio : VBR bitrate corrected for monochannel streams
x #1274999 : mp3Pro timing was wrong (2x the real timing)
+ "BitRate_Mode" with MP3 (VBR or CBR)
+ "PlayTime" with AC3
+ "PlayTime" with WAV
